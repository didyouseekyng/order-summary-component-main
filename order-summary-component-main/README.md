# Frontend Mentor - Order Summary Component Solution

![Preview](/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This is a solution to the [Order Summary Component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlpmajDUj). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
The purpose of this challenge for me was simply to fine tune my consciousness of writing code that is accessible.

## My Process

### Built with

- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### HTML
- I learnt how to use **label elements** for screen-reader users.
- i learnt how to test my code using the **#nomouse challenge** to see how accessible my site is with the keyboard.

##### CSS
- I reinforced my knowledge on **pseudo classes** while working on the hover states. 
- I reinforced my knowledge on **CSS background positioning** while working on the background image for mobile and desktop.

##### Scss
- I learnt how to work with **nesting media queries**.

### Continued development

These are some of the concepts I need to work on in future projects which needs to be refined:
- Web Accessibility
